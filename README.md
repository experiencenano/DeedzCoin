# DeedzCoin Smart Contract

The DeedzCoin smart contract is a decentralized application (DApp) written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. It serves as the underlying code for the DeedzCoin cryptocurrency, enabling token transfers and locking functionality.

## Features

### Token Transfers

Users can transfer DeedzCoin tokens to other addresses.

### Token Locking

Users can lock a specified amount of tokens for a specified duration, preventing them from being transferred until the lock expires.

### Locking with Actual Time

Users can also lock tokens until a specific timestamp, ensuring they remain locked until that time.

## Usage

To use the DeedzCoin smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum network of your choice (e.g., mainnet, testnet, or a local development network).
2. Interact with the deployed contract using an Ethereum wallet or DApp browser.
3. Use the following functions to interact with the DeedzCoin tokens:
   - `transfer`: Transfer DeedzCoin tokens to another address.
   - `transferWithLock`: Transfer and lock a specified amount of tokens for a specified reason and duration.
   - `transferWithLockActualTime`: Transfer and lock a specified amount of tokens until a specific timestamp.
4. Monitor events emitted by the contract to track token transfers and locking events.

## Development
